Without DI:

class CoffeeMachine {
  Grinder grinder = Grinder(); // Create a concrete Grinder instance
  Heater heater = Heater(); // Create a concrete Heater instance

  void brewCoffee() {
    grinder.grindBeans();
    heater.heatWater();
    // ... rest of the coffee brewing logic
  }
}

In this example, the CoffeeMachine directly creates instances of its dependencies (Grinder and Heater). This approach has some drawbacks:

Less Flexible: The CoffeeMachine class is tightly coupled to specific implementations of Grinder and Heater. It can't easily use different grinders or heaters.
Testing Challenges: Unit testing the CoffeeMachine becomes more complex because you need to mock or stub the concrete implementations of Grinder and Heater.
With DI:


class CoffeeMachine {
  final Grinder grinder;
  final Heater heater;

  CoffeeMachine(this.grinder, this.heater); // Dependencies injected through constructor

  void brewCoffee() {
    grinder.grindBeans();
    heater.heatWater();
    // ... rest of the coffee brewing logic
  }
}

In this approach:

The CoffeeMachine constructor takes the Grinder and Heater as arguments (dependencies).
This allows you to inject different implementations of these dependencies during object creation.
For example, you could create a FrenchPressCoffeeMachine that uses a ManualGrinder and an ElectricHeater, while an EspressoMachine might use a BurrGrinder and a Boiler.
Benefits of DI:

Improved Testability: By injecting dependencies, you can easily mock or stub them during unit testing, isolating the CoffeeMachine logic for better testing.
Increased Flexibility: The CoffeeMachine becomes more flexible as it can work with different implementations of its dependencies.
Loose Coupling: The CoffeeMachine is less tightly coupled to specific concrete implementations, promoting better code maintainability.
